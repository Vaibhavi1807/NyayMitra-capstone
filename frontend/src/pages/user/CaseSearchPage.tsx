/* =========================================================
   MY CASES

   Two screens behind one door: the list — with the CNR
   lookup above it, which is the only way a case enters
   here — and the matter itself. Keeping them here rather
   than in the router means the hero and the dashboard back
   button belong to the list only — a detail view has its
   own "All cases" link, and two competing back buttons in
   the same corner would be worse than one clear one.

   Each is mounted only while it is on screen, so returning
   to the list re-reads the store and shows whatever was
   saved in the meantime. No screen here creates a court
   case: cases are looked up by CNR and saved, never filed.
