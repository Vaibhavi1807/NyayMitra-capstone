   DELAY ANALYSIS

   The screen no longer asks for a CNR. It lists the account's
   live matters and puts one action on each, because nobody
   should have to look up a number that the app already holds
   in order to ask a question about their own case.

   Two things are shown, and they are kept apart on purpose.

   THE ESTIMATES come from POST /predict-delay (src/api.py),
   which returns both numbers in a single response: days to the
   next hearing, and days to disposal. Both are labelled as
   estimates, and both are read against closed cases, so the
   real figure for a running case can be shorter.

   THE REASONS below are derived from the record itself — age,
   stage duration, listed dates, hearing count — and are true
   today regardless of what the model says.
