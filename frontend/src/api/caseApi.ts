   NYAYMITRA — CASE STORE

   `mockCases` stays exactly as it is: the fixture, immutable
   and shared. This module adds the one thing a static array
   cannot do — let a citizen file a new matter — without
   forcing every existing reader to change how it reads.

   Only user-added cases are persisted. The seeds come from
   `mockCases` on every read, so fixing a fixture value (a
   stale hearing date, a renamed party) takes effect
   immediately instead of being trapped behind whatever was
   copied into localStorage the first time the app ran.

   Synchronous, like the auth and authority stores: the
   screens that read cases render on the first pass and
   there is no request to wait for.

   LOOKING A CASE UP BY CNR — the case service

   The store above is this browser's own bookkeeping. A CNR search
   is not: it asks the case service (NyayMitra-feature-lawyer-api)
   for one record, and the answer comes back shaped like every
   other `Case` on the screen, so the card and the detail view
   work on it without knowing where it came from.

   What the service returns is development data — a normalised
   copy of records captured manually from eCourts — and its
   provenance rides along on `data_source`, so the screen can
   say plainly what it is showing.
