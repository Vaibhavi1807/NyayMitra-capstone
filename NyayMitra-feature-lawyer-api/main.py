# ERROR HANDLING
#
# An unexpected failure must not hand a caller a Python stack
# trace: it can expose file paths, configuration and query
# text. The traceback is logged server-side (that is where it
# is useful) and the client gets a short, stable message.

    # surface as a bare "Failed to fetch" instead of the real error.
